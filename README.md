# WhiteBoard Collaborative Streaming

WhiteBoard is a collaborative remote streaming platform where users can watch YouTube videos together in sync. The platform uses WebSockets for real-time communication, a custom Chrome extension for video synchronization, and blockchain for room code generation. Users can join a "party" by entering a room code, and the playback will be synchronized across all users.

## Features:
- **Room Creation & Joining**: Users can create and join rooms using unique room codes.
- **Synchronized Playback**: Playback of YouTube videos is synchronized for all users in the same room.
- **WebSocket-Based Communication**: WebSockets are used to keep users in sync regarding playback state (play, pause, seek).
- **Chrome Extension**: Users can interact with the native YouTube UI and enjoy personalized recommendations while the video is synchronized across all users in the party.

## Prerequisites:

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) for the extension.
